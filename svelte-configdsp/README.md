# svelte-configdsp

Set up:

First, you need node js install. If you want to connect to a player, for now you need a CORS unblocker extension https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en

Install the npm packages:
`npm install` 


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
